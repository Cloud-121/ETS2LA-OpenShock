# ETS2LA-OpenShock

### Please note that this plugin is not a part of the ETS2LA project but has been developed by some of the projectâ€™s maintainers.

---

#### This is a plugin for ETS2LA 2.0 to provide physical feedback via OpenShock when you exit your lane while driving in ETS2. The plugin uses the OpenShock API to control a shocker device whenever the player drifts outside the lane with a custom-made library.

---

**Reminder:** Ensure shockers are placed safely to avoid physical harm. Refer to the diagram below for safe placement areas. **Never place shockers near the neck.**
