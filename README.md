# ETS2LA-OpenShock
## Please note this is not a part of the offical ETS2LA project.
### This is a plugin for ETS2LA 2.0 to provide physical feedback via openshock when you exit your lane while driving in ETS2. The plugin uses the OpenShock API to control a shocker device whenever the player drifts outside the lane with a custom made libary.
