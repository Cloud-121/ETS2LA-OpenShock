# ETS2LA-OpenShock

##This is a plugin for ETS2LA (Euro Truck Simulator 2 Lane Assist) 2.0 and the OpenShock API to provide physical feedback via a shock when you exit your lane while driving in ETS2. The plugin uses the OpenShock API to control a shocker device whenever the player drifts outside the lane with a custom made libary.
